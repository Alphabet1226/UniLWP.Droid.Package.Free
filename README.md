# UniLWP.Droid (Free Version) UPM Package

![](Documentation~/unity-banner.jpg)

UniLWP.Droid is an Android live wallpaper framework for Unity. With it, you can create Android Studio projects that compile to live wallpaper apps. This is the free version of it (full version on: [Asset Store](http://u3d.as/1QVw)), which only contains necessary code for live wallpaper service itself.  
For packaging purposes, the plugin is uploaded as an aar file. The java source can be found on the [JavaSource](https://github.com/JustinFincher/UniLWP.Droid.Free.JavaSource) repo.
